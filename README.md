. Algorithm :
    The proposed system follows a straightforward algorithm to analyze the sentiment of YouTube comments. Below is the step-by-step process:
    
- User Input:
The user interacts with the banking chatbot through a web interface built with Java, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, submitting a banking-related query.
- Receiving Query:
The chatbot frontend sends the user's query to the backend server using secure API communication.
- Retrieval Phase:
The RAG model uses an efficient retriever to search the knowledge base for the most relevant banking documents, FAQs, or policy information related to the user query.
- Augmentation:
Retrieved documents are passed along with the original user query to the Gemini model to provide context-rich information.

     Generation Phase:
         The Gemini model processes the combined input (query + retrieved documents) and generates a coherent, accurate, and domain-specific response for the user.

     Response Delivery:
         The backend server forwards the generated response back to the frontend chatbot interface.

     Display Output:
         The user sees the model's answer on the chatbot window in real-time, maintaining a natural and interactive conversation flow.

4. IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS :
   The development of the AI-driven powered chatbot for financial services is systematically divided into multiple functional modules.
Each module addresses a key part of the chatbot's operation — from understanding the user query to generating a secure, intelligent response.
This modular approach ensures flexibility, ease of maintenance, and better scalability of the system.
The following are the primary modules of the system:

- Module 1 : Query Understanding
  
    •	Purpose:
    •	To accurately interpret customer queries and extract the necessary information for further processing.
    •	Input Capture:
The system captures the user’s query through a web-based interface.
    •	Text Preprocessing:
The query undergoes cleaning — including lowercasing, tokenization, noise removal, and lemmatization.
    •	IntentRecognition:
Using a trained machine learning model, the system identifies the customer’s intent (e.g., balance inquiry, loan application, fraud reporting).
    •	Entity  Extraction:
Important details like account type, amount, customer name, or dates are extracted from the user query using named entity recognition (NER) techniques.
    •	Technologies Used:
    •	NLTK / spaCy for NLP tasks
    •	TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning models
    •	Scikit-learn for preprocessing

- Module 2 : Response Generation

   Once the chatbot successfully identifies the user's intent and extracts the necessary entities from the query, the next crucial step is the generation ofanappropriateresponse
Response generation ensures that the customer receives an accurate, contextually relevant, and human-like reply that addresses their banking needs effectively.
The chatbot employs a two-pronged strategy for generating responses:
first, by selecting from predefined response templates aligned to specific intents, and second, by dynamically constructing responses if user-specific details (such as account types, loan amounts, or transaction IDs) are involved.
For example, if a user asks about their "savings account balance," the chatbot identifies the 'balance inquiry' intent and dynamically generates a reply including the specific account type.
In scenarios where the user query falls outside the scope of trained intents or when ambiguity arises, the chatbot intelligently triggers a fallbackresponsemechanism.
Here, the bot politely asks the customer to rephrase their question or suggests related topics that it can assist with, maintaining a smooth user experience even in edge cases.
Moreover, the chatbot is equipped with a context management system, which ensures the flow of conversation across multiple turns.
For example, if a user begins a loan inquiry and then asks, "What about car loans?", the chatbot maintains context and continues the conversation appropriately without needing the user to restate earlier information.
Throughout the response generation process, the system prioritizes clarity, brevity, personalization, and security, ensuring that the communication feels natural and trustworthy to the customer.
By balancing predefined knowledge with dynamic response capabilities, the chatbot is able to simulate a highly efficient and intelligent banking assistant.

- Module 3 : Security and Authentication

     • Purpose:
To protect sensitive customer information and maintain compliance with data security standards.
Key Steps:
     •	Secure Communication:
All messages between the user and chatbot server are encrypted using SSL/TLS protocols.
     •	User Verification:
If a user requests access to confidential information (like account balance), the chatbot initiates an authentication step (e.g., asking for OTP verification).
     •	Session Management:
Each conversation is linked to a secure session ID to track and authenticate user activities throughout the interaction.
     •	Data  Privacy  Compliance:
The system ensures GDPR compliance by not storing sensitive customer data without consent.
      • Technologies Used:
  	  HTTPS protocols
         Secure token-based authentication (JWT / Session keys)
