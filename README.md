## AI-Powered Chatbot for Financial Services

### Overview

This project focuses on building an AI-powered chatbot for financial services to provide users with instant, accurate, and secure assistance related to banking, investments, loans, and customer support. The chatbot leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework to deliver context-aware responses grounded in verified financial data.

The solution aims to reduce customer service load, improve response time, and enhance user experience while maintaining data security and compliance.
